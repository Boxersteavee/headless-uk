# headless_placenl
A headless place nl client written in [python](https://www.python.org/).

To install the dependencies run `poetry install` 

> If you don't have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) then install it with:
> 
> `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -` for linux and 
> `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -` for windows

Start the client with `poetry run gaanmetdiebanaan`

If you have problems with poetry just delete `poetry.lock` and try again.
